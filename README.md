# Augmented Monte Carlo Localization

![gui][GUI]

This is an Augmented Monte Carlo Localization for a humanoid robot with line points observation that is similar to a mobile soccer robot in MSL League.

The idea is because we don't see the field lines all the time, why don't we observe the white points from a line or boundary of the outer field and then use those points to calculate our position?

### Self Localize
|Field Points | Field Lines | 
|---|---|
|![field-point][field_point] | ![field-lines][field_lines] |

![self-loc][self_loc]

### Kidnapping Problem
![kidnapping problem][kidnap]

### Simple line scanning to find field points
See the robot's fov area in white. This is a very simple using line iterator

|Field Points | Field Lines |

### Control

| Key | Action |
| -------- | -------- |
| W     | +5 in Robot's Y     |
| S     | -5 in Robot's Y     |
| A     | -5 in Robot's X     |
| D     | +5 in Robot's X     |
| E     | +2 in Robot's Heading     |
| Q     | -2 in Robot's Heading     |
| Use Heading | Sse robot's heading for weighting |
| Adaptive Particle | Use the adaptive particle algorithm |
| Debug Features | To view lines from robot fov |

### Requirements

    1. OpenCV 3
    2. Qt 5.9
    3. YAML
    4. C++11
