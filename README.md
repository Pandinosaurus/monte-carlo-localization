# Augmented Monte Carlo Localization

This is an Augmented Monte Carlo Localization for a humanoid robot with line points observation that is similar to a mobile soccer robot in MSL League.

The idea is because we don't see the field lines all the time, why don't we observe the white points from a line or boundary of the outer field and then use those points to calculate our position?

### Kidnapping Problem

### Simple line scanning to find field points
